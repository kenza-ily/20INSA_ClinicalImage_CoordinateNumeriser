# 20INSA_ClinicalImage_CoordinateNumeriser

## Overview

This project was developped during my Research and Biomechanics Internship at Skairos, in Summer 2020, in Paris, France. Skairos develops Spine Digital Twins for personalised medicine, more info [here]([url](https://skairos.io)).
This projects aimed at designed a Coordinate Extracting tool from for Spine X-Rays, but remains applicable for all 2D clinical images. It aims to facilitate the analysis and processing of clinical data by converting image-based information into a numerical format that can be easily utilized in various computational models and algorithms.

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· The project was conducted in French: the final report and the code comments are in French.

## Features
- **Image Processing**: Implements advanced algorithms to process clinical images and detect relevant markers or points of interest.
- **Coordinate Extraction**: Accurately identifies and extracts the coordinates of specific features within the clinical images through the live pointer.
- **Numerization**: Converts the extracted coordinates into a numerical format, making it suitable for statistical analysis, machine learning models, and other computational applications.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides tools for visualizing the extracted coordinates and the original clinical images, aiding in the verification and analysis of the data.
- **Compatibility**: Supports a wide range of image formats commonly used in clinical settings, ensuring broad applicability.
